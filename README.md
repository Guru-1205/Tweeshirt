🎨 Tweet-to-T-Shirt: AI-Powered Personalized Apparel

📌 Overview
Hey everyone, it’s **Gc** here!
This project integrates social media analytics, AI image generation, and user interaction to create personalized T-shirts featuring the most popular tweets. Using official APIs from platforms like Twitter, we retrieve and analyze tweet engagement metrics (likes, retweets, and comments) to determine the most viral content. The most popular tweet is then processed through Stability AI's Stable Diffusion Model to generate a visually appealing image.

Users can personalize their T-shirt by selecting size and color preferences. The system also collects shipping details and provides order tracking, ensuring a seamless experience from tweet analysis to product delivery. 🚀
